<hr>


### 1. What is Pandas

- Definition

  > Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.

&nbsp;

### 2. Important Data Types in Pandas

#### 2-1) Series
>A Series is a sequence of data similar to better known types of data such as a list in Python or a Numpy array.

<hr>

### 2-2) DataFrame
>DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dict of Series objects. It is generally the most commonly used pandas object.

<hr>

### 2-3) Index
>The row labels of a DataFrame are called index.
> If you donâ€™t have your own index, pandas will then automatically create an integer index starting at zero.
