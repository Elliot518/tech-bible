>ML systems can be classified according to the amount and type of
supervision they get during training.
They are: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, self supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and Reinforcement
Learning.
- Supervised learning
    >In supervised learning, the training set you feed to the algorithm includes
    the desired solutions, called labels.
    ```
    A typical supervised learning task is classification.
    eg:
     1) spam filter - it trained with many example emails along with their class 
        (spam or ham), and it must learn how to classify new emails.
     2) predict a target numeric value, such as the price of a car, given a set of 
        features (mileage, age, brand, etc.). This sort of task is called regression.
