## Foundations

<hr>

### 1. Vector
>A vector is an array of numbers, either continuous or discrete.
>
>In machine learning, we deal with multidimensional data, so vectors become very 
crucial.

```
eg:
Let’s say we are trying to predict the housing prices in a region based on the area of the house, 
number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and population density of the locality. 
All these features form an input feature vector for the housing price prediction problem.
```

### 2. Scalar

>A one-dimensional vector is a scalar.

&nbsp;

### 3. Matrix

>A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. The size 
of the matrix is determined by its row length and column length. If a matrix A has m rows and n columns, it can be represented as a rectangular object having m × n elements, and it can be denoted as Am × n.
