### 1. What is TensorFlow

- Authoritative Definition

  > TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.

- History

  > TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use in research and production.The initial version was released under the Apache License 2.0 in 2015.Google released the updated version of TensorFlow, named TensorFlow 2.0, in September 2019.

- Other Knowledge
  > TensorFlow can be used in a wide variety of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, C++, and Java.

### 2. Deep inside TensorFlow

Since we know that TensorFlow is a software library for machine learning, but what is machine learning?

#### What is Machine Learning

> Machine learning is a process where we train and deploy a computational model to predict some output given the data as input.

##### A machine learning problem typically consists of the following steps:

**1. Understanding analysis of data**
This is where you will explore the data provided to you (e.g., understand the dependent/independent variables).

**2. Cleaning data**
Real world data is usually messy, so data cleaning is of the upmost importance to make sure the model sees high-quality data.

**3. Feature engineering**
New features need to be engineered from the existing features or raw data.

4 Modeling—In this stage, you train a model using the selected features and corresponding targets.
5 Evaluation—After training the model, you must ensure it is reliable and can perform well on unseen data (e.g., test data).
6 Creating a user interface for stakeholders to use the model—In most cases, you will need to provide a dashboard/user interface for users to interact with the model.
