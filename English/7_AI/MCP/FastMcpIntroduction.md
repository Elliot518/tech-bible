## Fast MCP

<hr>


### 1. What is FastMCP

> FastMCP is a lightweight Python framework for rapidly developing MCP (Model Context Protocol) services. It provides a simple decorator (@app.tool()) for defining utility functions and automatically handles complex logic such as JSON-RPC communication, parameter validation, and service registration, allowing you to focus on writing your business logic. Simply put: FastMCP allows developers to write an MCP service in just a few lines of code.

_MCP enables LLMs(large language models) to call external tools, databases, and APIs_
