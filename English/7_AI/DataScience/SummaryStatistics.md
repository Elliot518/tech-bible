## Summary Statistics

<hr>

### 1. Analyzing the mean of a dataset

> The mean is considered the average of a dataset, it provides us with a sense of where the center of the dataset lies.

- How

    To calculate the mean, we need to sum up all the data points and divide the sum by the number of data points in our dataset.

### 2. Identifying the mode of a dataset

> The mode can be applied to both numeric and non-numeric values, it provides quick insights into the most common value. It is a very useful statistic, especially when used alongside the mean and median of a dataset.

- How

    To compute the mode, we used the stats module from the scipy library because a mode method doesnâ€™t exist in numpy.
