## NumPy Intoduction

### 1. What is NumPy

> NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is one of the most important foundational packages for numerical computing in Python.

Many computational packages providing scientific functionality use NumPy’s array objects as one of the standard interface for data exchange.

One of the reasons NumPy is so important for numerical computations in Python is
because it is designed for efficiency on large arrays of data.

- Performance & Efficiency
    > NumPy internally stores data in a contiguous block of memory, independent of
    other built-in Python objects. NumPy’s library of algorithms written in the C lan‐
    guage can operate on this memory without any type checking or other overhead.
    NumPy arrays also use much less memory than built-in Python sequences.

- Advantage

    > NumPy operations perform complex computations on entire arrays without the
    need for Python for loops, which can be slow for large sequences. NumPy is
    faster than regular Python code because its C-based algorithms avoid overhead
    present with regular interpreted Python code.
