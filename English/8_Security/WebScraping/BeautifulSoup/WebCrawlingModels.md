## Web Crawling Models

<hr>


### 1. Planning and Defining Objects

You don’t start a project that’s designed to be large and scalable by looking at a single website and saying, “What exists?” but by saying, “What do I need?” and then finding ways to seek the information that you need from there.

eg:
- Product title
- Manufacturer
- Product ID number (if available/relevant)

It’s important to note that none of this information is specific to a particular store. For instance, product reviews, ratings, price, and even description are specific to the instance of that product at a particular store. That can be stored separately.
