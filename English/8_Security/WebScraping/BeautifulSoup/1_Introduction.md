### 1. What is Beautiful Soup

- Authoritative Definition
  > Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.

&nbsp;

### 2. Install

For installing BeautifulSoup 4 is as following:

- 2-1) install bs4 library by pip

```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

- 2-2) install a parser
  Beautiful Soup supports the HTML parser included in Pythonâ€™s standard library, but it also supports a number of third-party Python parsers.

  a. install lxml
  One is the lxml parser.

  ```
  pip install lxml
  ```

  b. install html5lib
  Another alternative is the pure Python html5lib parser, which parses HTML the way a web browser does.

  ```
  pip install html5lib
  ```
