### 1. What is CSS

> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a powerful programming language that transforms the presentation of a document or a collection of documents.

- example
    ```css
    h1 {color: maroon;}
    body {background: yellow;}
    ```

### 2. CSS Rule Structure

![css rule structure](https://github.com/Elliot518/mcp-oss-tech/blob/main/frontend/css/css_rule_structure.png?raw=true)


> Each rule has two fundamental parts: the selector and the declaration block. The declaration block is composed of one or more declarations, and each declaration is a pairing of a property and a value. Every stylesheet is made up of a series of these rules.

- selector
    > The selector, shown on the left side of the rule, defines which piece of the document will be selected for styling(eg: h1 (heading level 1), p (paragraph)).

- declaration block
    > Each declaration is a combination of a CSS property and a value of that property.
