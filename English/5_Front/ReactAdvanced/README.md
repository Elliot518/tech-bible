### 1. What is State

**State is what makes your applications move**

> State is a mutable data source that can be used to store data in a React application and can change over time and be used to determine how your component renders


State is mutable, which means that it can be changed over time. <br>
When a state variable changes, your React component will re-render to reflect any changes that the state causes to your UI.

- Some State Examples

    a) Data you just fetched through a request

    b) The light or dark mode option of a UI

    c) A list of errors that you got from filling a form in the UI
