## Tailwind CSS

<hr>


### 1. What is Tailwind CSS

> Tailwind is a set of prebuilt CSS classes that can be used to style an app. It is referred to as a utility first CSS framework because the prebuilt classes can be thought of as flexible utilities.

An example CSS class is bg-white, which styles the background of an element white â€“ bg is short for background. Another example is bg-orange-500, which sets the background color to a 500 shade of orange.


- example
  
  _(styles a button element in JSX):_
  ```javascript
  <button className="border-none rounded-md bg-emerald-700 text-white cursor-pointer">
    ...
  </button>
  ```

    content: [
      './index.html',
      './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    ],
    theme: {
      extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
  }
  ```

#### 2-4) Ensure Your CSS File Imports Tailwind Directives

Make sure your src/index.css file imports the Tailwind directives:

add the following three lines at the top of the file
```javascript
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
