<hr>


### 1. Using Create React App

> Create React App is a popular tool for creating React projects. It is based on webpack.

Visual Studio Code->Terminal
```bash
npx create-react-app myapp-name --template typescript
```
npx allows npm packages to temporarily be installed and run. It is a common method of running project scaffolding tools such as Create React App.
create-react-app is the package for the Create React App tool that creates the project.

### 2. Adding linting to Visual Studio Code

> Linting is the process of checking code for potential problems. It is common practice to use linting 
tools to catch problems early in the development process as code is written.

- ESLint
    > ESLint is a popular tool that can lint React and TypeScript code.

    _Fortunately, Create React App has already installed and configured ESLint in project._

2-1) install an ESLint extension into Visual Studio Code
