## Create Gradle Project

<hr>

### 1. Using Spring Initializr creating a project

1. Open Spring Initializr by navigating to https://start.spring.io using your web browser.

2. We will generate a Gradle - Groovy project with Java and the latest stable Spring Boot 3.1.x version.

3. By clicking the ADD DEPENDENCIESâ€¦ button, we will select the starters and dependencies that are needed in our project.
We will start our project by selecting two dependencies: 
Spring Web and Spring Boot DevTools.
    - The Spring Boot DevTools dependency gives us the Spring Boot developer tools, which provide an automatic restart functionality. This makes development much faster because the application is automatically restarted when changes have been saved.
    
    - The Spring Web starter pack is a base for full stack development and provides an embedded Tomcat server.

4. Finally, click on the GENERATE button, which generates a project starter ZIP package for us.
