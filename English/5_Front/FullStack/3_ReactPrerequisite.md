### 1. Introduce React Components

> React is component-based, and the components are independent and reusable. Components are the basic building blocks of React.

_When you start to develop a UI with React, it is good to start by creating **mock interfaces**. That way, it will be easy to identify what kinds of components you have to create and how they interact._


#### From the following mock UI, we can see how the UI can be split into components.

- Example

_In this case, there is be an application root component, a search bar component, a table component, and a table row component._
