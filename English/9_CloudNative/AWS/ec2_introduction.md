## AWS EC2

<hr>


### 1. What is AWS EC2

> Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud aka Amazon EC2 is a web service that allows users to lease virtual servers, known as instances, for running workloads and applications within the AWS ecosystem.

#### Amazon EC2 is a web service offered by AWS to rent servers on a pay-as-you-go basis.

_EC2 allows businesses to quickly deploy, scale, and manage applications in the AWS cloud. 
EC2 streamlines IT operations by eliminating the need for purchasing physical hardware and reducing the time and effort required for infrastructure management._

Amazon EC2 has been instrumental in the transformation of computing. By significantly reducing the complexities of handling physical servers, EC2 allows developers to very much concentrate on writing code and creating innovative solutions without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

### 2. Benefits of EC2

- Cost efficiency
  One of the most compelling benefits of EC2 is the cost efficiency. With a pay-as-you-go pricing model, users only pay for the computing resources they use, eliminating the need for upfront investments in hardware or long-term commitments. This model simply allows organizations to adjust their computing resource flexibly to match their actual demand without pre-planning extensively.
  - On-Demand Instances
    Allow you to pay for an hour or second, with no long-term commitments.

  - Reserved Instances 
    Let you reserve an instance for a specific period (say, one or three years) at a discounted price.  

  - Spot Instances
    Enable you to bid for unused EC2 capacity and can provide significant cost savings for workloads that can tolerate interruptions.
