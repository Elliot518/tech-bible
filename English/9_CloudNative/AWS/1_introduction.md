### 2. What is Cloud computing

> Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network
access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (networks, virtual machines, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Cloud computing, or the cloud, is a metaphor for supply and consumption of
IT resources. The IT resources in the cloud arenâ€™t directly visible to the user; layers of abstraction exist in between. The level of abstraction offered by the cloud varies, from offering virtual machines (VMs) to providing Software as a Service (SaaS) based on complex distributed systems. Resources are available on demand in enormous quantities, and you pay for what you use.

#### five essential characteristics for cloud computing:
- On-demand self-service
  > The cloud enables us to provision resources ad hoc with the click of a button or an API call

- Broad network access
  > Capabilities are available over the network

- Resource pooling
  > The cloud assigns resources based on a multitenant model, which means consumers share the same physical and virtual resources

- Rapid elasticity
  > The cloud allows us to expand and shrink the provisioned capacity on demand

- Measured service
  > The cloud provides metrics allowing consumers to gain insights into the utilization of their resources
