## Common Commands

<hr>


### 1. nohup
```shell
nohup command &
```

> We often run a very important program. Sometimes this program takes several hours or even days to run. At this time, if we exit the terminal, or the network is not good and the connection is interrupted, the program will be terminated. This situation is definitely not what we want to see. We hope that even if the terminal is closed, the program can still run. At this time we can use the nohup command.The nohup command is the abbreviation of the English phrase no hangup, which means not to hang up, that is, the program does not exit.

tar -zxvf somefile.tar.gz
