### 1. What is Spring Boot

- Authoritative Definition

  > Spring Boot Extension is Spring's convention-over-configuration solution for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can "just run".
  
  Minimizes the need for initial configuration
  Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

  Spring Boot also favors a runtime model based 
  on a standalone JAR file, also known as a fat JAR file.

  Before Spring Boot, the most common way to run a Spring application was to deploy it as a WAR file on a Java EE web server, such as Apache Tomcat. 
  And WAR file deployment is still supported by Spring Boot.
