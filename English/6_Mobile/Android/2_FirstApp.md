## First Android Application

<hr>


### 1. What is an activity

> An activity is an instance of Activity, a class in the Android SDK. An activity is an entry point into your application and is responsible for managing user interaction with a screen of information.

You can write subclasses of Activity to implement the functionality your app requires. 


_A simple application may need only one subclass; a complex application may have many._

### 2. What is layout

> A layout defines a set of UI objects and the objectsâ€™ positions on the screen.


_A layout is made up of definitions written in XML. Each definition is used to create an object that appears onscreen, like a button or some text._
