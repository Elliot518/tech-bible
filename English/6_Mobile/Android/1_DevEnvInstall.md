### 2. Installing additional Android SDK packages

The steps performed so far have installed the Android Studio IDE and the current set of default Android SDK packages.

To install older versions of the Android SDK simply select the checkboxes  corresponding to the versions and click on the Apply button.

Support older versions of Android as far back as Android 8.0 (Oreo), this is to ensure that the apps run on a wide range of Android devices. Within the list of SDK versions, enable the checkbox next to Android 8.0 (Oreo) and click on the Apply button.
