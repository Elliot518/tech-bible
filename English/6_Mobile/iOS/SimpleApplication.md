### 2. Interface Builder

> Interface Builder is an object editor that can create instances of objects and manipulate their properties. Interface Builder divides the editor area into two sections: the document outline, on the lefthand side, and the canvas, on the right


The rectangle that you see in the Interface Builder canvas is called a scene and represents the only “screen,” or view, your application has at this time

#### 2-1) How to create view objects
To add them, first show the library by clicking the + button near the top-right corner of Xcode
